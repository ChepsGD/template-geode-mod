# RireDLL
riredll is a fork of feurdll by Jeantasoeur that adds more features and fixes stuff he did and is mostly a custom mod for my own gdpses doing what i want instead of dinde

~~it only hooks the more games button and uses techstudent's function. why not put a config like dankmeme did bruv~~

RireDLL hooks the more games button and the map button! It also removes the versus mode button and adds a site link button so you dont get lost!
